FILE_VALIDATION_PROMPTS = {
    "image_validation": """
Analyze this image and determine if it contains a valid invoice or receipt. Be liberal in your interpretation - this is for a WhatsApp Invoice Assistant that helps users track their expenses.

A valid invoice/receipt includes:
1. ANY document showing a purchase transaction (store receipts, invoices, online order confirmations, etc.)
2. Documents showing goods or services purchased with pricing
3. Any payment confirmation with vendor and amount information

IMPORTANT GUIDELINES:
- Retail receipts, store receipts, and simple payment confirmations ARE valid invoice documents
- If you can identify a vendor/merchant name and a total amount, it's likely a valid invoice/receipt
- Documents don't need to have ALL formal invoice elements to be valid
- When in doubt about borderline cases, classify as valid rather than invalid
- Even simple receipts with just store name, date and total ARE valid for our purposes

Respond with a JSON object with the following structure:
{
    "is_valid_invoice": true/false,
    "confidence_score": 0.0-1.0,
    "missing_elements": ["list of missing formal elements if any"],
    "reasons": "detailed explanation for the decision"
