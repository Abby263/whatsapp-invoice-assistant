# OUTPUT
Classify the input into one of the following intent categories:
1. Greeting - Simple greetings like "hi", "hello", "good morning", etc.
2. General - General questions about the assistant's capabilities, how to use it, or requests for help
3. InvoiceQuery - Questions about existing invoices, such as "Show me invoices from last month" or "Find invoices from Amazon"
4. InvoiceCreator - Requests to create a new invoice or enter invoice data manually

Return only the intent category name without any additional text or explanation.
