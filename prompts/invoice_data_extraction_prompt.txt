- invoice_number: The unique identifier for the invoice
- invoice_date: The date the invoice was issued (YYYY-MM-DD format)
- due_date: The date the invoice is due (YYYY-MM-DD format)
- vendor: The company/person who issued the invoice
- total_amount: The total amount to be paid
- currency: The currency code (e.g., USD, EUR)
- status: The status of the invoice (usually "pending" for new invoices)
- notes: Any additional notes provided
- items: A list of items on the invoice, each with:
  - description: Description of the item
  - quantity: The quantity purchased
  - unit_price: The price per unit
  - total_price: The total price for this item

Return the result in JSON format with only the extracted fields. If a field is not found in the input, omit it from the output or set it to null.
