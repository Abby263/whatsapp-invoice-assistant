- due_date: The date the invoice is due (YYYY-MM-DD format)
- vendor: The company/person who issued the invoice
- total_amount: The total amount to be paid
- currency: The currency code (e.g., USD, EUR)
- status: The status of the invoice (e.g., pending, paid)

- items: A list of items on the invoice, each with:
  - description: Description of the item
  - quantity: The quantity purchased
  - unit_price: The price per unit
