IMPORTANT SECURITY REQUIREMENTS:
1. Every query MUST include a filter on the user_id field to ensure data isolation.
2. For direct table queries, add "WHERE user_id = :user_id" to filter for the current user.
3. For JOINs, ensure the primary table is filtered by user_id (e.g., "WHERE invoices.user_id = :user_id").
4. Never return data for all users - always filter by the specific user making the request.
5. Use :user_id as a parameter in all queries to enable proper binding during execution.
6. IMPORTANT: The user_id is stored as an INTEGER, not a UUID. Don't use UUID functions or casting.
7. ALWAYS assume user_id is an integer field in all tables.
8. NEVER use the 'status' column in the invoices table - it doesn't exist in the actual database.
