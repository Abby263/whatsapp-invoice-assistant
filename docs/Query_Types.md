# AI Invoice Assistant: Complete Application Flow and Query Types

## Overview
The **AI Invoice Assistant** is a WhatsApp-based AI application designed to assist users in managing their invoices and business expenses. It processes both text-based queries and file uploads (e.g., images, PDFs, Excel, CSV) and responds based on the detected intent or input type. Built using a **LangGraph-based architecture** with memory integration, the application ensures conversational context is maintained across interactions. The technical stack includes:

- **Database**: PostgresSQL (stores user data, invoices, and conversation history)
- **LLM**: GPT-4o-mini (handles intent classification, data extraction, and SQL query generation)
- **Framework**: FastAPI (powers the server-side logic)
- **WhatsApp Integration**: Twilio (enables communication via WhatsApp)
- **Workflow Orchestration**: LangGraph (manages the flow of queries through various nodes)

Every node in the LangGraph workflow follows a consistent structure, with differences only in prompts and configurations (e.g., LLM model, specific variables) defined in a `constants.py` file. All responses are formatted consistently using a dedicated `Response Formatter Node` before being sent to the user.

## Query Types, Inputs, Flows, and Expected Responses

The application categorizes user inputs into seven distinct query types. Below, each type is detailed with examples of input queries, the processing flow, and the expected response.

### 1. GREETING

1. **Input Received**: The user sends a greeting via WhatsApp.
2. **Twilio Webhook**: The message is received by the Twilio webhook and forwarded to the FastAPI server.
3. **Router Node**: Identifies the input as text and routes it to the `Text Intent Classifier Node`.
4. **Text Intent Classifier Node**: Uses GPT-4o-mini to classify the intent as **GREETING**.
5. **Response Preparation**: A predefined greeting template is selected as the response.
6. **Response Formatter Node**: Structures the response with a disclaimer for consistency.
7. **Output Sent**: The formatted response is sent back to the user via Twilio.
